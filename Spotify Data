#In this exercise we downloaded data from Kaggle to play around with and explore. With the dataset I found the answers to the following quesitons#

# Whats the average danceability/artist/track?
SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name, track_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name

Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT distinct artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

What artist released the longest song? 
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1

What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs? (Work in progress: Thinking that finding the top 10 most popular songs first makest the most sense to me, then finding danceability, however SQLiteStudio does not like my queries) 

SELECT danceability , popularity, artist_name FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
